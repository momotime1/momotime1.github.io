**Shogo** 

When you put in the effort, you're a very capable Computer Scientist. I look forward to seeing you get another chance to make something you're proud of during our webapps. 

#### Iterative Development [1/3]
- Great detailed commit messages
- I would like to see at the very least 1 commit per class
- You did not touch the README.md at all, despite accessing outside sources

#### Design Specifications [2/3]
- Good job following your design specification 
- I would have also liked to see justification for why you chose to make changes from your original design, such as dropping the text segments

#### Design Implementation [1/3]
- Unfortunately there are some noticable issues with your implementation, including the broken "Interests" link and overlaping text and images
- Your code is not very efficient, for example having two classes of the same name and using multiple <br> for spacing instead of using CSS
